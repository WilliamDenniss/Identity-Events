# Identity-Events
Identity Events is an IETF specification project intended to define a set of JSON and REST specifications that enable 
the publication and exchange of events related to identities. For more information, see:  identity events ietf.org

These drafts were started after the establishment of the id-events@ietf.org mailing list. The work began after 
several participants noticed common event requirements that have emerged from SCIM provisioning, OIDC (eg. Logout),
RISC Events (e.g. account suspension, reset, take-over), as well as OAuth2 (e.g. token revocations), and consent 
notification (e.g. consent from a distributes OAuth/UMA system).

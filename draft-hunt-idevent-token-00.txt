1.  Introduction and Overview

   [[introduction text here]]

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify
   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the interoperability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986].

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification uses definitions from the specification
   [idevent-subscription].

2.  Events

   An identity event conveys a message (in the form of a token) about
   security subject that may be of interest to a subscriber or set of
   subscribers participating in an event feed (see
   [idevent-subscription]).

   An event message is indicated by the attribute "schemas" having one
   value as "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:Event" and more or more
   additional values indicating one or more event extension schema URIs.
   An event extension schema URI indicates to the reader what event
   information and event types are contained in the event message.  The
   attribute "resourceUris" specifies one or more affected resources
   which are the subject of the event.

   The schema and structure of an event follows the SCIM schema model as
   defined in [RFC7643].  This means that an event has the following
   aspects:

   o  a common set of attributes common to every event, and

   o  one or more schema extensions (see Section 3 of [RFC7643]) that
      each define a set of attributes that belonging to an extension.

   The following non-normative example shows a password change event:

   {
     "schemas":[
       "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:Event",
       "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:Event:SCIM:password",
       "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:Event:RISC:password"
     ],
     "publisherUri":"https://scim.example.com",
     "feedUris":[
      "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
      "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "resourceUris":[
       "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9"
     ],
     "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:Event:SCIM:password":{
       "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
       "resetCount":5
     },
     "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:Event:RISC:password":{
       "terminateSession":true
     }
   }

   The above example shows an event that has a dual-extension and
   actually expresses a password update event.  The event has a dual-
   extension which allows two different sub-events to be expressed based
   on one state change at the publisher.  Multiple events MAY be
   asserted at the same time (when appropriate), and carry different or
   even overlapping attributes.  This is expressed by placing the event
   extensions each within its own JSON object (in this example,
   "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:Event:SCIM:password" and
   "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:Event:RISC:password").  In
   this example, a SCIM event indicates that a password has been updated
   and the current password reset count is 5.  The other extension is a
   "RISC" extension and lets a subscriber know that any current sessions
   associated with the subject should be terminated.

   By expressing multiple extensions at the same time, the publisher
   indicates that each event type stems from the same originating event.
   Publishers MAY split a single event into multiple separate events
   (e.g.  each with only one event schema extension).  Publishing
   single-events may be more important when it is appropriate to
   minimize information disclosure to a particular subscriber or set of
   subscribers.

2.1.  Core Event Properties

   The following are attributes that may be included in an event
   message:

   schemas
      A multi-valued String attribute that MUST contains the value
      "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:Event" and at least one other event
      extension URIs.

   feedUris
      A multivalued String containing the URIs of the feeds the event is
      associated with.  The publisher may filter these values to be only
      those values relevant to a particular subscriber.  In doing so,
      the publisher is not obligated to deliver repeated events to the
      same subscriber.

   publisherUri
      A single valued string containing the URI of the service provider
      publishing the event.  For example, in SCIM, this is the SCIM
      Service Provider's root endpoint.

   resourceUris
      A multi-valued string that contains the URIs of one or more
      affected resources in the event.  For each resource URI included,
      the event must be identical.  For each event extension expressed,
      each extension MUST apply to each resourceUris value.

2.2.  Event Token

   An Event Token is a JWT ([RFC7519])that is constructed by building a
   JSON structure (see [RFC7159]) that constitutes an event "message"
   and which is then used as the body of a JWT.

   While this specification uses JWT to convey an event message,
   implementers SHALL NOT use these events to convey authentication
   assertions or identity tokens[[references??]].

   The following is an example event message(it has been modified for
   readability):

   {
     "schemas":[
       "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:Event",
       "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:Event:SCIM"
     ],
     "publisherUri":"https://scim.example.com",
     "feedUris":[
      "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
      "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "resourceUris":[
       "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9"
     ],
     "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:Event:SCIM:create":{
       "attributes":["id","name","userName","password","emails"],
       "values":{
         "emails":[
          {"type":"work","value":"jdoe@example.com"}
         ],
         "password":"not4u2no",
         "userName":"jdoe",
         "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
         "name":{
           "givenName":"John",
           "familyName":"Doe"
         }
       }
     }
   }

                     Figure 1: Example Event JSON Data

   When transmitted, the above JSON body must be converted into a JWT as
   per [RFC7519].  In this example, because the event contains attribute
   values, the token MUST be encrypted per JWE (see [RFC7516]) before
   transmission.

   [[Figures below need to be updated to reflect the new message body
   above]]

   The following is an example of a SCIM Event expressed in an unsecured
   JWT token.  The JWT header of:

   {"alg":"none"}

Appendix A.  Appendix A.  Event Types

A.1.  SCIM Event Types

   This specification defines 8 events.  Additional event types may be
   defined using the Event Type IANA registration process described in
   Section 4.1.

   ADD
      The specified resource URI was added to the feed.  An add does not
      necessarily indicate a resource is new or has been recently
      created, but rather that it has been added to a feed.  For
      example, an existing user has had a new role (e.g.  CRM_User)
      added to their profile which has caused their resource to join a
      feed.

   CREATE
      The new resource URI has been created at the service provider and
      has been added to the feed.  When a CREATE event is sent, a
      corresponding ADD event is not issued.  For example, a new user
      was created via HTTP POST, whose attribute profile met the
      criteria of a current feed.

   ACTIVATE
      The specified resource (e.g.  User) has been activated or is
      otherwise available for use.  [TODO: this seems to be a higher
      level concept that may consist of multiple attributes changing -
      How to differentiate between activate and MODIFY events]

   MODIFY
      The specified resource has been updated (e.g. one or more
      attributes has changed).

   DEACTIVATE

Internet-Draft          draft-hunt-idevent-token           February 2016


      The specified resource (e.g.  User) has been deactivated.  [TODO:
      Is there a corresponding MODIFY event?]

   DELETE  The specified resource has been deleted from the service
      provider and is also removed from the feed.  When a DELETE is
      sent, a corresponding REMOVE is not issued.

   REMOVE
      The specified resource has been removed from the feed.  Removal
      does not indicate that the resource was deleted or otherwise
      deactivated.

   PASSWORD
      The specified resource (e.g.  User) has changed its password.  If
      secure exchange is possible with the subscriber, the event may
      also include the raw password update text.  A PASSWORD event MUST
      be transmitted in encrypted form (see Section 2.2).

   CONFIRMATION  A special event that is used during Polling Feed
      Registrations and Web Callback URI subscriptions to confirm
      successful configuration of an event feed.  The contents of a
      CONFIRMATION event SHALL be defined by the registration process
      documented in following sections [TODO add reference]

1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification defines an extensible event token format which may
   be exchanged using protocols such as HTTP.  The specification builds
   on the JSON Web Token format [RFC7519] in order to provide a self-
   contained message "token" that can be optionally signed using JSON
   Web Signature [RFC7515] and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption
   [RFC7516].

   For the purpose of this specification an "event" is a statement of
   fact by a publisher (also known as the issuer) that the state of a
   resource it controls has changed in some way (explicitly or
   implicitly).  Based on some agreed upon criteria for an event feed,
   the publisher distributes the event to the appropriate subscribers.

   At the time of writing of this specifications there are several
   discussions regarding the need for identity events.  Some of these
   include:

   o  Events to allow SCIM resource co-ordination between SCIM domains.

   o  OAuth Token Revocation (see [RFC7009])

   o  OpenID Logout or downstream logout notification.

   o  Session Cancellation

   o  OpenID Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) Events.  See
      [RISC]

   o  The HEART WG [HEART] which intends to define privacy and security
      related events in health-related data sharing APIs.

   This specification uses example SCIM events which are intended to be
   non-normative for the purpose of showing how an event may be extended
   in typical use.

   A resource state change event MAY include explicit changes such as: a
   resource that has been created, modified, removed, or updated.  In
   addition to explicit changes of state, there may be higher-level
   conclusions made that describe an effect resulting from a change.
   For example, a publisher may wish to indicate that a user resource
   has taken over an email identifier that may have been used in the
   past.  This hypothetical event is a high-level conclusion that takes
   into account that another resource had a personal identifier that
   potentially conflicts with a newer resource.  Because of the
   potential security impact, the publisher may wish to notify its
   subscribers of the identifier re-use.  In this way, the event is not
   describing a particular state change to a resource, it describes a
   meta-conclusion based on its own business and security rules (this is
   often called an 'account take-over' event).

   A subscriber having received an event, takes its own independent
   action, if any.  For example, having been informed of a personal
   identifier now being associated with a different resource (i.e. is
   being used by someone-else), the subscriber may choose to ensure that
   the new user is not granted access to resources associated with the
   previous user.

   Events SHOULD NOT be used to convey commands or requests.  To do so
   requires complex bi-directional signaling and error recovery
   mechanisms which fall outside the scope of this specification.  The
   intent of this specification is to define a way of stating historical
   statements of fact that subscribers may interpret for their own use.

   This specification is scoped to security and identity related events.
   While event tokens may be used for other purposes, the specification
   only considers security and privacy concerns relevant to identity and
   personal information.

   This specification is intended to be optionally used with the
   identity event subscription management specification which provides

   the details of event feeds and how subscribers register for
   events(see [idevent-subscription]).

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify
   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the interoperability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986].

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification uses definitions from the specification
   [idevent-subscription].

2.  Events

   An identity event conveys a message (in the form of a JWT token
   [RFC7519]) about a resource (e.g. a security subject) that may be of
   interest to a subscriber or set of subscribers participating in an
   event feed (see [idevent-subscription]).

   In addition to the JWT attributes "iss" and "aud", an event message
   contains the attribute "eventUris" with at least one value containing
   the URI prefix "urn:ietf:params:event:".  The event URI values
   indicate what event information and event types are contained in the
   event message.  The definition of registered events are found in the
   event registry (see Section 4.2).

   The attribute "resourceUris" specifies one or more affected resources
   which are the subject of the event. [should resourceUris be
   required?? Or could it be required as part of an extension schema]

   The schema and structure of an event follows the JWT [RFC7519].  An
   event JWT has the following characteristics:



Hunt, et al.           Expires September 20, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          draft-hunt-idevent-token              March 2016


   o  a common set of attributes common to every event, and

   o  one or more event extensions that each contain a set of attributes
      that belonging to an extension.

   The following is a non-normative example showing a password change
   event that conveys both a hypothetical RISC event and a SCIM event
   (see [idevent-scim]) in the same message:

   {
     "eventUris":[
       "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:password"
     ],
     "iss":"https://scim.example.com",
     "aud":[
      "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
      "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "resourceUris":[
       "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9"
     ],
     "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:password":{
       "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
       "values":{
         "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:account:2.0:Password":{
           "resetAttempts":5
         }
       }
     }
   }

   The event in the figure above expresses hypothetical password reset
   event for SCIM.  The JWT consists of an "iss" attribute which denotes
   the event publisher.  The "aud" attribute specifies the intended
   audience for the event.  In practical terms this MAY be the the URI
   for the event feed that a client has subscribed to.

   Additional extensions to an event may be added by adding more values
   to the "eventUris" attribute.  For each event URI value specified,
   there is a corresponding attribute that has its on JSON object that
   contains the attributes associated with that event (e.g.
   "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:password").  In this example, the SCIM
   event (see [idevent-scim]) indicates that a password has been updated
   and the current password reset count is 5.  Notice that the value for
   "resetAttempts" is actually part of its own JSON object
   _urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:password_.

2.1.  Core Event Attributes

   The following are attributes that may be included in an event
   message:

   eventUris
      A multi-valued String that contains the URIs of events contained
      within the JWT.

   aud
      A multi-valued String containing the URIs representing the
      audience of the event.  Values are typically URLs of the feeds the
      event is associated with.  When an event has multiple audiences
      that go to the same subscriber, the publisher is not obligated to
      deliver repeated events to the same subscriber.

   iss
      A single valued String containing the URI of the service provider
      publishing the event (the issuer).  For example, in SCIM, this is
      the SCIM Service Provider's root endpoint.

   resourceUris
      A multi-valued String that contains the URIs of one or more
      affected resources in the event.  For each resource URI included,
      the event must be identical.  For each event extension expressed,
      each extension MUST apply to each resourceUris value.

2.2.  Event Token

   An Event Token is a JWT ([RFC7519])that is constructed by building a
   JSON structure (see [RFC7159]) that constitutes an event "message"
   and which is then used as the body of a JWT.

   While this specification uses JWT to convey an event message,
   implementers SHALL NOT use these events to convey authentication or
   authorization assertions.

   The following is an example event message(it has been modified for
   readability):

   {
     "eventUris":[
       "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:create"
     ],
     "iss":"https://scim.example.com",
     "aud":[
      "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
      "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "resourceUris":[
       "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9"
     ],
     "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:create":{
       "attributes":["id","name","userName","password","emails"],
       "values":{
         "emails":[
          {"type":"work","value":"jdoe@example.com"}
         ],
         "password":"not4u2no",
         "userName":"jdoe",
         "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
         "name":{
           "givenName":"John",
           "familyName":"Doe"
         }
       }
     }
   }

                     Figure 1: Example Event JSON Data

   When transmitted, the above JSON body must be converted into a JWT as
   per [RFC7519].  In this example, because the event contains attribute
   values, the token MUST be encrypted per JWE (see [RFC7516]) before
   transmission.

   The following is an example of a SCIM Event expressed in an unsecured
   JWT token.  The JWT header of:

   {"alg":"none"}

   Base64url encoding of the octets of the UTF-8 representation of the
   header yields:

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Registration of Event URN Sub-namespace

   IANA has added an entry to the "IETF URN Sub-namespace for Registered
   Protocol Parameter Identifiers" registry and created a sub-namespace
   for the Registered Parameter Identifier as per [RFC3553]:
   "urn:ietf:params:event".

   To manage this sub-namespace, IANA is requested to create the "Event"
   Registry which shall be used to manage entries within the
   "urn:ietf:params:scim" namespace.  The registry description is as
   follows:

   o  Registry name: Event

   o  Specification: [this document]

   o  Repository: [see Section 4.2]

   o  Index value: values [see Section 4.2]

1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification profiles the Identity Event Token [idevent-token]
   to define events for SCIM Protocol [RFC7644].

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify
   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the interoperability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986].

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification uses definitions from the specification
   [idevent-token].

2.  SCIM Events

   SCIM events JSON objects that are encoded in JWT form as per
   [idevent-token].  An event includes a eventUri which indicates the
   type of event and the event specific attributes.  An event also
   includes standard JWT attributes "iss" and "aud" which indicates the
   event publisher (issuer) and the event feeds (audience).

   The following is an example SCIM Create event message(it has been
   modified for readability):

   {
     "eventUris":[
       "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:create"
     ],
     "iss":"https://scim.example.com",
     "aud":[
      "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
      "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "resourceUris":[
       "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9"
     ],
     "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:create":{
       "attributes":["id","name","userName","password","emails"],
       "values":{
         "emails":[
          {"type":"work","value":"jdoe@example.com"}
         ],
         "password":"not4u2no",
         "userName":"jdoe",
         "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
         "name":{
           "givenName":"John",
           "familyName":"Doe"
         }
       }
     }
   }

                     Figure 1: Example Event JSON Data

   In the above example, the user "jdoe" is created with values an email
   address, an initial password, and a name.  Note that when raw data is
   sent, it is advisable to protect the event using JWE (see Section 2.2
   [idevent-token]).

2.1.  Event Schema URIs

   The following defines the schema URI for events used by SCIM:

   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:add
      The specified resource URI was added to the feed.  An add does not
      necessarily indicate a resource is new or has been recently
      created, but rather that it has been added to a feed.  For
      example, an existing user has had a new role (e.g.  CRM_User)
      added to their profile which has caused their resource to join a
      feed.

   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:create
      The new resource URI has been created at the service provider and
      has been added to the feed.  When a CREATE event is sent, a
      corresponding ADD event is not issued.  For example, a new user
      was created via HTTP POST, whose attribute profile met the
      criteria of a current feed.

   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:activate
      The specified resource (e.g.  User) has been activated or is
      otherwise available for use.  [TODO: this seems to be a higher
      level concept that may consist of multiple attributes changing -
      How to differentiate between activate and MODIFY events]

   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:modify
      The specified resource has been updated (e.g. one or more
      attributes has changed).

   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:deactivate
      The specified resource (e.g.  User) has been deactivated.  [TODO:
      Is there a corresponding MODIFY event?]

   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:delete
      The specified resource has been deleted from the service provider
      and is also removed from the feed.  When a DELETE is sent, a
      corresponding REMOVE is not issued.

   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:remove
      The specified resource has been removed from the feed.  Removal
      does not indicate that the resource was deleted or otherwise
      deactivated.

   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:password
      The specified resource (e.g.  User) has changed its password.  If
      secure exchange is possible with the subscriber, the event may
      also include the raw password update text.  A PASSWORD event MUST
      be transmitted in encrypted form (see [idevent-token]).

2.2.  SCIM Event Attributes

   The following attributes are defined for all of the schema URI
   defined in Section 2.1 or any schema defined within the uri namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:events:SCIM".

   id
      An optional multi-valued SCIM "id" value of the affected
      resource(s) as defined in Section 3.1 [RFC7643].  If provided the
      identifiers MUST correspond to the values referenced in
      "resourceUris".

   attributes
      A multi-valued list of affected SCIM attributes.  Each attribute
      listed may be a fully-qualified attribute name or an attribute
      "path" as defined in Figure 7 of Section 3.3.2 of [RFC7644]

   values
      A JSON object structure containing the affected attributes and
      their associated values.  If the "values" attribute is supplied,
      the event message MUST be encrypted.  Service providers SHOULD
      take care to ensure that eligible subscribers are able to see
      attribute values.  Alternatively, subscribers MAY use the
      resourceURIs to retrieve the final attribute values.  When doing
      so, the SCIM service provider can then assess the subscribers
      right to obtain the actual attribute values.

      For a password change event, the clear text password attribute
      value MAY be included in the values attribute.  "PASSWORD" event.

3.  Security Considerations

   [[TO BE COMPLETED]]

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers the schema extensions found in Section 2.1 in
   the "Event" registry as per Section 4.2 [idevent-token].

   Schema URI:  See Section 2.1.

   Schema Name:  See corresponding names under Section 2.1.

   Intented ResourceType:  N/A.  Events are not intended to be persisted
      in SCIM.

   Purpose:  See each description in Section 2.1.

   Single-valued Attributes:  None.

   Multi-valued Attributes:  All schemas in this specification share the
      same attributes.  See Section 2.2.
